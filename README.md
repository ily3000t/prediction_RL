# Prediction RL

Local reproduction and action-conditioned prediction research based on
`jlubars/RL-MPC-LaneMerging`.

Current stage: P1 compatibility and bounded smoke. Source supplied by the user
remains in `RL-MPC-LaneMerging-master/`; no directory migration is implied.
Original DDPG, reward and continuous jerk control are retained.

Upstream publication permission is unresolved. Do not publish vendored code or
weights. `provenance/` records source identity; `reports/` records verification.
Large/generated outputs belong under ignored `artifacts/`.

The shared pytorch environment is used at the user's request. Do not silently
downgrade its core packages. No formal training is authorized in this stage.
